# Syndicated Loans Protocol - Stellar

Syndicated loans are large loans that are provided by a group of lenders, known as a syndicate, to a single borrower. This approach allows lenders to share the risk associated with large loans and enables borrowers to access larger amounts of capital than they could from a single lender.
